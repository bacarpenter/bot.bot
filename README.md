## Deployment

To deploy this project, I use repl.it free hacker plan for students. Learn more about setting up a Repl.it [here](https://docs.replit.com/tutorials/01-introduction-to-the-repl-it-ide). And getting your free, time limited, hacker plan [here](https://education.github.com).

Alternatively, any PaaS provider that allows for always online python projects should work just fine!
